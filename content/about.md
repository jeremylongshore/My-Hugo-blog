# Jeremy Longshore
## AI Engineer & Speed DevOps Specialist
### *Gulf Shores, Alabama*

*Building production systems that actually work. No fluff, no promises - just shipped code.*

---

## Background

Based in Gulf Shores, Alabama, I've spent years perfecting the art of rapid deployment without sacrificing quality. My approach: leverage AI tools to eliminate the mundane, focus on architecture that scales, and ship working products while others are still planning.

**Recent highlight**: Built DiagnosticPro's entire data architecture (254 BigQuery tables) in 4 days using AI-accelerated development.

## What I Actually Do

### ðŸ”§ Systems That Scale
- **BigQuery Expert**: 254 production tables, automated import pipelines
- **Data Architecture**: YouTube/Reddit/GitHub scrapers processing 500K+ records  
- **RSS Automation**: 226+ feed validation system with N8N workflows
- **AI Integration**: GPT-4 diagnostic systems, LangChain implementations

### âš¡ Speed DevOps Philosophy
Traditional development: "We'll have an estimate in 2 weeks."  
My approach: "It's deployed. Want to see?"

Real example: DiagnosticPro went from concept to production BigQuery deployment in 4 days. Not a demo, not a prototype - production system processing real automotive data.

## Philosophy

> *"Show, don't tell. Ship, don't promise."*

I don't believe in MVPs that are minimum and not viable. I build systems that work on day one and scale to day 1000. AI tools amplify good engineering - they don't replace it.
